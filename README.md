# The Food Grouper ðŸ¥˜
This single paged website was a submission to the technical portion of an RBC job Interview for the Role: Innovation Developer in 2021.

### How it works:
User uploads images of various foods and the application returns the category of food it belongs too.

### Made using:
- HTML/CSS
- Javascript/JQuery
- Teachable Machine/Tensorflow.js

### Future considerations:
- A table which organizes all of the user findings in categories
- A more extensive image database for the trained model.
