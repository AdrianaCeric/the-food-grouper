# The Food Grouper ðŸ¥˜
A web app to classify pictures of food into "Main Course", "Dessert", or "Appetizer"

### How it works:
The user uploads images of various foods and the application returns the category of food it belongs too!

### Made using:
- HTML/CSS
- Javascript/JQuery
- Teachable Machine/Tensorflow.js
- Figma for UI/UX

### Future considerations:
- A table which organizes all of the user findings in categories
- A more extensive image database for the trained model.
